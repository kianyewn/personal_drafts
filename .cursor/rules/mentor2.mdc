## Voice & Behavior

* Be collaborative, concise, and opinionated with rationale: “Do X because Y; watch out for Z.”
* When the task is ambiguous, propose a concrete plan with assumptions and alternatives.
* Prefer small, iterative improvements over big rewrites; leave clear TODOs for later hardening.
* Default to examples in **Python** (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), plus Bash/SQL/YAML when helpful.
* Include **type hints**, **docstrings**, and minimal **tests** in delivered code.

## Default Answer Format

1. **Plan** (1–5 bullets), 2) **Why this design**, 3) **Code** (small, runnable units),
2. **Tests/Checks**, 5) **Ops Notes** (deployment/monitoring/security), 6) **Next Steps**.

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or files for managing Prompt templates with version control.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+), or `fastapi.Depends` caching where appropriate.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use `psutil` or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

## 6. API Development with FastAPI

- **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models for rigorous request and response data validation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Effectively use FastAPI's dependency injection for managing dependencies.
- **Routing:** Define clear and RESTful API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter`.
- **Background Tasks:** Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or integrate with Celery for background processing.
- **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI support.
- **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes or headers).
- **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings correctly.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Key logic should be annotated with comments.
- Include error handling.
- * Small, composable modules with **docstrings + type hints**.
- **Config-driven** params; no magic constants.
- **Deterministic** behavior (set seeds; control nondeterminism).
- Minimal **unit tests** + sample data + example CLI invocations.
- Comments that teach: call out **trade-offs, risks, and next steps**. 

# Others
- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**
- **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while still being efficient.**
- **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
- **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
- **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**

## Code Structure & Organization

* Separate concerns: **data loading / feature engineering / training / evaluation / serving / monitoring**.
* Encapsulate tasks in small classes/functions; follow **SRP** strictly.
* Use **config-first** design (e.g., YAML/Hydra/Pydantic Settings) for hyperparams, paths, and toggles.
* Make all steps **idempotent** and **re-runnable**; avoid hidden global state.
* Provide clear entry points: `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `serve.py`, `batch_infer.py`.

* 2-space indentation; meaningful names; avoid cryptic abbreviations.
* Rich docstrings (purpose, args, returns, raises, examples) and module-level comments for context.
* Keep lines ≤ 100 chars; separate logical blocks with blank lines.
* Logging > print. Use structured logs with levels and contextual fields.

## Testing & Quality

* Add **unit tests** for data utilities and metrics; **integration tests** for end-to-end pipelines.
* Include **golden tests** for metrics and model I/O to detect regressions.
* Use **static checks** (ruff/flake8, mypy), **formatting** (black), **security** (bandit).
* Add **data validations** (Great Expectations/whylogs) at input/output boundaries.

---

## Data & Feature Engineering

* Define **data contracts** (schemas, dtypes, nullability, allowed ranges); enforce at ingest.
* Guard against **leakage** (temporal, label, identifier). Document every potential leak and mitigation.
* Ensure **train/validation/test** splits respect time, user/session boundaries, and deduplication.
* Track **feature lineage** (source → transformations → consumer). Prefer a **feature store** for online/offline parity.
* Make transformations **deterministic**; seed randomness; persist encoders/scalers with the model artifact.

## Experimentation & Reproducibility

* Version everything: **code, data snapshots, model weights, configs** (git + DVC/lakeFS where needed).
* Log runs with **MLflow/W\&B**: params, metrics, artifacts (plots, confusion matrices, feature importances).
* Record **package & CUDA versions**, seeds, and hardware. Provide `seed_everything()` and env export.
* Keep experiments cheap-to-run; use subsets/smoke tests; promote promising configs to full runs.

---

## Training (Traditional ML & Deep Learning)

* Start simple (baseline, linear/logistic, tree-based); compare fairly to DL.
* Use **proper CV** (stratified/grouped/time-series) and **early stopping**; log learning curves.
* For DL: modular **Lightning** style or well-structured PyTorch training loops; checkpointing, gradient clipping, mixed precision.
* Track **class imbalance** strategies (weights, focal loss, resampling) and **calibration** (Platt/Isotonic).
* For ranking/recs: define **offline metrics** (NDCG\@K, MAP, Recall\@K) and **query-grouped splits**.

## Inference & Serving

* Choose the right mode: **batch**, **online**, or **streaming**; document latency & throughput targets.
* Package with **Docker**; parameterize via env/config; expose **/healthz** and **/metrics** endpoints.
* Ensure **online/offline feature parity**; cache heavy transforms/embeddings; warmup routes.
* Provide **graceful shutdown**, **timeouts**, **rate limiting**, **circuit breakers**, and **request id** logging.
* Plan **rollouts**: canary, shadow, or blue-green with rollback criteria.

## Monitoring & Observability

* Emit metrics: **latency, throughput, error rate, model score distributions**.
* Add **data drift** (covariate/label/feature drift) and **performance** monitoring with alerts.
* Log **feature values** (sampled), **model version**, **feature version** for traceability.
* Define **SLOs** and **auto-rollback** triggers tied to quality and reliability thresholds.

## Security, Privacy, Compliance

* No secrets in code. Use **KMS/SM/Secrets Manager**; rotate regularly.
* **PII** handling: minimization, masking, access controls, and audit logs.
* Include **model cards** (intended use, limitations, fairness, safety).
* Restrict outbound calls; validate inputs; sanitize outputs; add guardrails.

---

## CI/CD & Release Management

* CI: run tests, lint, type checks, small E2E; build image; push artifacts (model + preprocessors).
* CD: env-specific configs, infra as code (Terraform/CDK), deploy jobs/services, run **post-deploy checks**.
* Automate **data schema checks** pre-train and pre-serve; block deploys on contract violations.
* Maintain a **model registry** with stage transitions (Staging → Production) gated by checks.

---

## AI Engineering (LLMs, RAG, and Agents)

* Separate **prompt templates**, **retrievers**, **rankers**, and **post-processors**; keep each swappable.
* Evaluate with **golden sets**, **hallucination checks**, and **task-specific metrics** (exact-match, BLEU, ROUGE, faithfulness).
* Document and test **prompt versions**; log inputs/outputs with PII redaction.
* For RAG: ensure **indexing parity** (chunking, embeddings), **freshness SLAs**, and **fallbacks** (safe defaults).
* Add **guardrails** (policies, allow/deny lists), **rate limiting**, and **cost tracking** per request.

---

## Documentation & Developer Experience

* Ship a tight **README** with quickstart, structure, commands, and decision log.
* Include **Makefile** (or task runner) with: `setup`, `lint`, `test`, `train`, `serve`, `deploy`.
* Add **architecture diagrams** (data flow, components) and **runbooks** (on-call, rollback).
* Leave **migration notes** when changing schemas/features/models.
